# EasyBootstrap Documentation

EasyBootstrap is a Unity asset that simplifies scene bootstrapping and management. With EasyBootstrap, you can easily define bootstrap scenes and execute tasks before transitioning to gameplay scenes.

Remember that you can always hover the mouse over a field in the inspector to see a tooltip with more information about the field.
This documentation will guide you through the key features and usage of the asset.

## Getting Started

To get started with EasyBootstrap, follow these steps:

1. Import the EasyBootstrap package into your Unity project from the Asset Store.

2. Open the EasyBootstrap settings editor window from the toolbar: `Tools -> EasyBootstrap -> Settings`.

3. Configure the bootstrapping settings as needed.

4. Run your project in the Unity editor, and EasyBootstrap will handle the scene bootstrapping.

## Bootstrap Scenes

EasyBootstrap allows you to define bootstrap scenes that are loaded before the gameplay scenes. These bootstrap scenes are defined in the EasyBootstrap settings.

### Enable Editor Bootstrapping

In the EasyBootstrap settings, you can enable or disable editor bootstrapping. When bootstrapping is disabled, no scenes are loaded before the gameplay scenes. Please note, this does not affect a built project.

### Defining Bootstrap Scenes

In the settings, you can specify a list of bootstrap scenes. These scenes will be loaded in the specified order before transitioning to gameplay scenes.

### Post-Bootstrap Scene Handling

EasyBootstrap provides options for handling scenes after the bootstrap scenes are loaded. You can change this behaviour for both the editor and build individually. You can choose from the following options:

- **Do nothing:** The game remains in the last loaded bootstrap scene.
- **Load back to current scene:** The game loads the scene that was active before bootstrapping.
- **Load Post-Bootstrap Scene:** The game loads a specific scene after bootstrapping.

## IBootstrappable Interface

EasyBootstrap allows you to define bootstrap tasks by implementing the `IBootstrappable` interface. This interface defines a `Task` object, that represents the initialization process. All tasks are completed before transitioning to the next scene.
This feature is perfect for for example downloading new game content/updating over web during the app startup.

To create a bootstrap task:

1. Create a C# MonoBehaviour that implements the `IBootstrappable` interface.

2. Implement the `Initialize` method, which contains your bootstrap logic.

3. (Optionally) implement `BootstrapCallOrder` to specify the order in which the task is executed in relation to other `IBootstrappable` instances in the same scene. Lower values are executed first.

4. Attach your script to a GameObject in a bootstrap scene.

## Main Settings Editor Window

EasyBootstrap provides a custom editor window for configuring bootstrap settings. To access this window, go to the Unity toolbar:
`Tools -> EasyBootstrap -> Settings`

In the custom editor, you can for example:

- Enable or disable editor bootstrapping.
- Define bootstrap scenes.
- Configure post-bootstrap scene handling (for both editor and build individually).

---

## Example Usage

Here's an example on how to use EasyBootstrap:

1. Enable bootstrapping in the settings.

2. Define your bootstrap scenes in the settings, specifying their order.

3. Create C# scripts that implement the `IBootstrappable` interface for any bootstrap tasks.

4. Attach these scripts to GameObjects in your bootstrap scenes.

5. Run your Unity project, and EasyBootstrap will handle the scene bootstrapping and task execution.
